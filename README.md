# Scriptorium

We call this repository the [Scriptorium](https://g.co/kgs/Va839H). It contains documents and notes for the organization.

We began using this repository in April 2023. The content is:

- saved in Markdown format for portability
- tracked using Git version control
- stored in a GitHub repository for shared access
- includes AI integration (using Obsidian)

## Use a Markdown editor

Use your favorite Markdown editor as an interface for reading and writing notes. Learn more about Markdown at the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and see our own list of recommended [[Markdown editors]].

*Note: Links in `[[double brackets]]` are local "wikilinks" that work in most Markdown editors. You'll need to view this file with a Markdown editor to click the local wikilinks.*

We recommend the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Markdown editor because it will:

- save automatically to the GitHub repository with the [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin 
- use AI with the [Obsidian Text Generator Plugin](https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin) 

Here are instructions for [Cloning this repo and installing Obsidian](https://github.com/greater-agency/greater-scriptorium/blob/main/Resources/Note-taking/Obsidian/Cloning%20this%20repo%20and%20installing%20Obsidian.md) (or locally [[Cloning this repo and installing Obsidian]]).

If you don't like the Obsidian UI, you can use your favorite Markdown editor for writing and still use Obsidian for GitHub backups and AI prompting. After all, you can use more than one tool to work with Markdown files.

## More about the repository

### AI integration

We use AI for research, formatting, and writing as well as software development and product features. This repository includes OpenAI API prompts in the folder `textgenerator/prompts` for use with the [Obsidian Text Generator Plugin](https://github.com/nhaouari/obsidian-textgenerator-plugin).  You can use the plugin's templates for prompt engineering, including experimenting with prompts that might be useful for product features.

### Structure

This repository is organized into folders using the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), a "universal system for organizing digital information." Read more about [[How the repository is organized]].
