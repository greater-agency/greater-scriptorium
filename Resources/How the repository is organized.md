To organize this repository, we use the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), a "universal system for organizing digital information," developed by Tiago Forte. The acronym stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives, which are the four useful organizational categories used to classify and manage notes and documents.

A big benefit of the PARA organizational method is the option to move documents into Archive when they are no longer current or relevant. Thus Projects, Concerns, and Resources will only contain current and relevant documents.

Here are the top level directories (folders):

### [[Projects]]

- For our works in progress. If a project will at some point in time be "finished" it belongs here. These are tasks or goals that require multiple steps to complete and usually have a deadline. They represent specific objectives we want to achieve.

### [[Concerns]]

- Our folder for information about the things we do regularly, tools and tech we use, and processes we implement. Unlike projects, this category is for ongoing activities that will not end, including responsibilities or focus areas that require regular attention and effort. We call this category "Concerns"; the author of the PARA methods calls it "Areas of Responsibility."

### [[Resources]]

- A place to collect “notes for later.” Our space for information that is relevant or interesting but not needed for something we are working on now. Often this is information that you frequently refer to or need to accomplish your work or goals.

### [[Archive]]

- The graveyard. It’s for things that aren’t relevant anymore but we keep them around in case we ever need to look back. These old notes or documents are stored separately from active information to ensure that our active workspace remains clutter-free and focused on current projects and concerns.

### PARA workflow

In our case, we slightly modify the PARA categories. Here's an example workflow:  Resources → Projects → Concerns → Archive.

When reading about something that is interesting, you might create a page in the Resources folder, and add a link, or screenshot or summary. 

Later, you might transfer that page to the Projects or Concerns folder, if we are organizing some work for a project or an ongoing concern.

If at any point we abandon or complete a project, or no longer continue a process that is a concern, then the page would be transferred to the Archive.
