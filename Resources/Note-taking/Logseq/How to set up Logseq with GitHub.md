Using Logseq as your Markdown editor, you can manually or automatically sync your notes to GitHub, creating a backup of your Obsidian vault as a GitHub repository. This approach is useful for version control, collaborating on notes with other team members, and accessing notes across different devices.

Logseq has built-in inetgration with GitHub, which allows you to back up your files to a remote Git repository, such as a private repo on GitHub. Logseq supports automatic Git commits by default. When you enable Git integration in Logseq settings, it will automatically commit your changes every 60 seconds. You can configure automatic syncing or backup of Logseq with GitHub by using Git hooks. A Git hook is a script that runs automatically when a specific event occurs in a Git repository. In this case, you can create a `post-commit` hook that automatically pushes your changes to the remote GitHub repository every time a commit occurs in Logseq.

From phind.com, asking "How does Logseq integrate with GitHub?":

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up Logseq with GitHub (from [hub.logseq.com](https://hub.logseq.com/integrations/aV9AgETypcPcf8avYcHXQT/logseq-sync-with-git-and-github/krMyU6jSEN8jG2Yjvifu9i)):

1.  Create a new GitHub repository: Log in to your GitHub account and create a new public or private repository.
    
2.  Clone the repository to your local computer: Use a Git client like GitHub Desktop or the command line to clone the repository to your local machine.
    
3.  Set up Logseq: Download and install Logseq on your computer. Open Logseq and choose "Open a local directory" as the storage option. Select the cloned repository folder.
    
4.  Configure Logseq to use Git: In Logseq, click on the gear icon to open the settings. Under "Integration," enable "Git integration." This will allow Logseq to use Git for syncing your notes with the GitHub repository.
    
5.  Sync your notes: You can now use the "Sync" button in Logseq to push your changes to the GitHub repository. Logseq will automatically commit your changes and sync them with the remote repository.
