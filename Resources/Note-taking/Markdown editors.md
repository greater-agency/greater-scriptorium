See a [comparison of Dendron with other tools](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/b33d1803-6e4e-418f-a269-c4d4bde967cf/).

If you don't want to use a Markdown editor that integrates directly with GitHub, you can use other tools to commit your Markdown files to GitHub, such as Git from the command line or GitHubâ€™s official GUI app [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). You can also search Google for [GUI Git Clients for Mac](https://www.fossmint.com/gui-git-clients-for-mac/).

The [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) offers a comprehensive list of [Markdown tools](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/), including many other Markdown editors.
