Obsidian has a concept of "vaults." A vault is just a folder on your hard drive. When you designate a folder as a vault, Obsidian will create a hidden folder containing configuration files that set the Obsidian user interface.

Let's look at how to create a vault for journal entries.

To get started:
- Create a `Journal` folder on your Mac in Documents
- Launch Obsidian
- From the Obsidian default window, select "Open folder as vault" and choose the `Journal` folder

Opening a folder as an Obsidian vault creates a hidden `.obsidian` folder containing configuration files. The configuration files control the appearance and functionality of the Obsidian application. You can lose the configuration files and the Obsidian application and still use any Markdown files with any other application. Really, "Open folder as vault" just means "create configuration files" to display a folder within the Obsidian application.

You can create folders on your hard drive for any kind of notes. For example, I've got a folder `All-My-Notes` for "personal knowledge management" and I open that in Obsidian as a separate vault.

If you want to backup your vault to GitHub, see the instructions for [[Creating an Obsidian vault for backup to GitHub]].

Obsidian allows users to create "vaults," which are folders on their hard drive that contain configuration files controlling the user interface of the Obsidian application. One can create a vault for journal entries by creating a folder, launching Obsidian, and selecting "Open folder as vault." Folders can be created for any kind of notes, and backups can be made to GitHub by following specific instructions.
