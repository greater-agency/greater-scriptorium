Using Obsidian as your Markdown editor, you can manually or automatically sync your notes to GitHub, creating a backup of your Obsidian vault as a GitHub repository. This approach is useful for version control, collaborating on notes with other team members, and accessing notes across different devices.

Obsidian integrates with GitHub through Denis Olehov's [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), which allows you to back up your Obsidian vault to a remote Git repository, such as a private repo on GitHub. The plugin provides commands such as listing changed files, opening diff view, staging and unstaging files, and committing all changes, as well as automated backup to GitHub.
