You can clone this GitHub repository, which means downloading the files to make a local copy. After you've cloned the repository locallly, you can install [[Markdown editors]] to edit the files. I recommend the Obsidian Markdown editor.

This repository contains Markdown files which can be used with any Markdown editor. The repository ws created with Obsidian and contains additional Obsidian configuration files (in the top-level hidden folder `.obsidian/`) so you can easily clone the repository, install Obsidian, and open the repository as an Obsidian vault (see [[What is an Obsidian vault]]).

Here are instructions for cloning this repository and installing Obsidian.

You'll need a GitHub account a [greater-agency](https://github.com/greater-agency) repositories. 

From your Terminal in any convenient folder you use for current projects:

```
git clone https://github.com/greater-agency/greater-scriptorium.git
```

Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Then:
- Launch Obsidian
- From the Obsidian default window, select "Open folder as vault" and choose the `greater-scriptorium` folder

You're ready to explore the Markdown files! Start with the [[README]].

## AI integration

Access to the OpenAI API using the Obsidian Text Generator Plugin requires an OpenAI API key. For security, we don't include the API key in the GitHub repo. To use the AI features, you'll have to configure the plugin with the OpenAI API key.

See the section "Configuration" in [[How Obsidian integrates with AI]].
